# Implementing Privileged Access Workstation

## Overview

A Privileged Access Workstation (PAW) is a hardened device dedicated to performing sensitive administrative tasks. This skill covers PAW design using the tiered administration model, device compliance enforcement via Microsoft Intune or Group Policy, just-in-time (JIT) access provisioning, and integration with privileged access management (PAM) platforms like CyberArk and BeyondTrust.


## When to Use

- When deploying or configuring implementing privileged access workstation capabilities in your environment
- When establishing security controls aligned to compliance requirements
- When building or improving security architecture for this domain
- When conducting security assessments that require this implementation

## Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11 Enterprise with Virtualization Based Security (VBS)
- Microsoft Intune or Active Directory Group Policy
- CyberArk Privileged Access Security or BeyondTrust Password Safe (optional)
- Python 3.9+ with `requests`, `subprocess`, `json`
- Administrative access to target endpoints

## Steps

1. Audit current privileged access patterns and identify Tier 0/1/2 assets
2. Configure device hardening baselines (AppLocker, Credential Guard, Device Guard)
3. Enforce compliance policies via Intune or GPO
4. Implement just-in-time access with time-limited admin group membership
5. Integrate with CyberArk/BeyondTrust for credential vaulting
6. Validate PAW configuration against CIS and Microsoft PAW guidance
7. Monitor privileged sessions and generate compliance reports

## Expected Output

- JSON report listing device compliance status, hardening checks, JIT access windows, and PAM integration verification
- Risk scoring per workstation with remediation recommendations
