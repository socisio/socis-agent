# Implementing File Integrity Monitoring with AIDE

## Overview

AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment) is a host-based intrusion detection system that monitors file and directory integrity using cryptographic checksums. This skill covers generating AIDE configuration files, initializing baseline databases, running integrity checks, parsing change reports, and setting up automated cron-based monitoring with alerting.


## When to Use

- When deploying or configuring implementing file integrity monitoring with aide capabilities in your environment
- When establishing security controls aligned to compliance requirements
- When building or improving security architecture for this domain
- When conducting security assessments that require this implementation

## Prerequisites

- AIDE installed on target Linux system (apt install aide / yum install aide)
- Root or sudo access for file system scanning
- Python 3.8+ with standard library

## Steps

1. **Generate AIDE Configuration** — Create aide.conf with monitoring rules for critical directories (/etc, /bin, /sbin, /usr/bin, /boot)
2. **Initialize Baseline Database** — Run aide --init to create the initial file integrity baseline
3. **Run Integrity Check** — Execute aide --check to compare current state against baseline
4. **Parse Change Report** — Extract added, removed, and changed files from AIDE output
5. **Configure Automated Monitoring** — Generate cron job for scheduled integrity checks
6. **Generate Compliance Report** — Produce structured report of all file changes with severity classification

## Expected Output

- AIDE configuration file (aide.conf)
- Baseline database creation status
- JSON report of file changes (added/removed/changed) with severity
- Cron job configuration for automated monitoring
